# Galactic Mega Slaughter

A simple FPS game made with **OpenGL** from scratch, entirely made with C++ for my Computer Graphic academical project. Strongly inspired by **DOOM-like** fps, this is my first ever custom 3D engine written using low level graphical libraries (and more specifically using ONLY **Legacy/FreeGlut**), so i tried to mantain things as simple as possible.

The goal of this project was basically creating a virtual 3D interactive environment. This game presents some features:

- **Animations**
- **Multitexturing**
- **Object istantation** (could render over 100+ object in the scene) 
- **Raycasting and Picking** 
- **Collision Detecting**
- **File reading**

and more.

# Requirements
The only requirement to build this project is VS2022. This due to the developing done entirely using Visual Studio 2022 Community edition, so if you want to build it from scratch you need that exact version or you'll have some trouble compiling it. 

# Release
If you want to try to build it by yourself, you can find the Binary release [Here].(https://pages.github.com/).
Otherwise, you can download an .exe file [Here].(https://pages.github.com/).

# Resources
The resources used in this project are entirely copyright free. Special Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/@WhiteBatAudio for the OST of the game.
