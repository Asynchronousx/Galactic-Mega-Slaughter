# Galactic Mega Slaughter

A simple FPS game made with OpenGL from scratch, entirely made with C++ for my Computer Graphic academical project. Strongly inspired by DOOM-like fps, this is my first ever custom 3D engine written using low level graphical libraries (and more specifically using ONLY Legacy/FreeGlut), so i tried to mantain things as simple as possible.

The goal of this project was basically creating a virtual 3D interactive environment. This game presents some features:

- Animations
- Multitexturing 
- Object istantation (could render over 100+ object in the scene) 
- Raycasting and Picking 
- Collision Detecting 
- File reading 
and more.
