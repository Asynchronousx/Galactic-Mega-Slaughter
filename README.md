# Galactic Mega Slaughter

A simple FPS game made with <b>OpenGL<\b> from scratch, entirely made with C++ for my Computer Graphic academical project. Strongly inspired by <b>DOOM-like<\b> fps, this is my first ever custom 3D engine written using low level graphical libraries (and more specifically using ONLY <b>Legacy/FreeGlut<\b>), so i tried to mantain things as simple as possible.

The goal of this project was basically creating a virtual 3D interactive environment. This game presents some features:
<b>
- Animations
- Multitexturing 
- Object istantation (could render over 100+ object in the scene) 
- Raycasting and Picking 
- Collision Detecting 
- File reading 
<\b>
and more.
